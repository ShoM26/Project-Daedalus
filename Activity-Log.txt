8/18/25: Project Daedalus: The aim of this task is to build something impressive. Something equal to the Labyrinth to show future employers that I have the necessary skills and if I don't have them this is my attempt to build them. I will log each days work in this note as documentation to show myself and others the progress I have made and how one could replicate it.

8/19/25: My focus today was on increasing my presence on LinkedIn and revamping my resume. With the absence of Nikane I was wondering if there would be a void of committed computer science students that I could surround myself with. Today Felix Prewitt and I talked about the path he plans to take to secure an internship and then eventually a job. He may not have the same skills I do right now but it is nice to have other people actively working towards their goals outside of the classroom. This will be a good year for us. I need to look into getting my GitHub looking more professional but I have a basis to start applying to jobs now that I have the first impression factor. Shout-out LinkedIn Projects section, subsided some of my imposter syndrome today. Hoping to get better about that this year.

8/20/25: Downloaded Rider, DataGrip, updated my github a bit(trying to get the student developer package), Created a general roadmap that I will have to expand on soon tomorrow will probably be the first day where I am writing code. Also generated a context prompt that I will use when starting new chats with claude/gpt, will need to keep updating it as I iron out the specifics of my project.

8/21/25: Created the backend project, made my simple hello world controller, designed the database schema and updated other repos in my GitHub to look more professional

8/25/25: Back from New York with recharged and ready to tackle the database. I built the project files today and created the sql scripts to create the tables. Connected the DB and scaffolded which is a cool concept to save the lift of writing entities and messing up things along the way. Going to start branching now that everything is built out. Need to update context prompt, move parts of it into the about me section of AI profile and The next plan is to draw out the backend architecture.

8/26/25: Put in some work today. Sorted out EF core and migrations which should prove helpful in the coming months. Made a diagram of the backend and worked on the repository layer. The project feels 65% setup right now and I am going to start getting into the meat of the Repository method writing. CRUD for generic repo then once those are inherited I will work on the specific repo methods. Then it is on to Arduino facing APIs(I think GET). Excited and energized.

8/27/25: Accomplished a good amount today. Ran an EF core migration while in database management systems class lol. wrote the CRUD and specific methods for repository layer and began working on the Data Ingestion service. For that I downloaded postman to test my newly created DTO and controller method for sensor readings. Not fully working yet but I will lock that down tomorrow and see what the next steps are. Need to be better about smaller branches because I completely forgot to merge after the repository changes.

8/28/25: Didnt do much today. Controller method fixed itself or something and merged into main. Nothing beyond this. Work life balance or something

8/29/25: Also not much progress gained today but created the shells for the controllers and wrote out the SensorReading controllers. Lots of work to do this weekend

8/30/25: Lots done today. Wrote many api requests. Basic CRUD ones and some specific. Only one more controller to write before I merge that branch into main. Also ran an ef core migration and wrote a repository method. Got to get on top of this so I can move onto the hardware element soon. I believe itll be one of the more challenging things.

8/31/25: Work-life balance kinda day. Learned more about the relationship between controller and repo today. With that new knowledge I cleaned up the controllers a bit. Just a couple more methods to write before I test and merge the branch with main
