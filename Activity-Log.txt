8/18/25: Project Daedalus: The aim of this task is to build something impressive. Something equal to the Labyrinth to show future employers that I have the necessary skills and if I don't have them this is my attempt to build them. I will log each days work in this note as documentation to show myself and others the progress I have made and how one could replicate it.

8/19/25: My focus today was on increasing my presence on LinkedIn and revamping my resume. With the absence of Nikane I was wondering if there would be a void of committed computer science students that I could surround myself with. Today Felix Prewitt and I talked about the path he plans to take to secure an internship and then eventually a job. He may not have the same skills I do right now but it is nice to have other people actively working towards their goals outside of the classroom. This will be a good year for us. I need to look into getting my GitHub looking more professional but I have a basis to start applying to jobs now that I have the first impression factor. Shout-out LinkedIn Projects section, subsided some of my imposter syndrome today. Hoping to get better about that this year.
