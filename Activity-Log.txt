8/18/25: Project Daedalus: The aim of this task is to build something impressive. Something equal to the Labyrinth to show future employers that I have the necessary skills and if I don't have them this is my attempt to build them. I will log each days work in this note as documentation to show myself and others the progress I have made and how one could replicate it.
