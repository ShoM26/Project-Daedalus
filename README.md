Project Daedalus ðŸŒ±

An IoT-Enabled Plant Monitoring System

Project Daedalus is a full-stack system that combines IoT sensors, a C# ASP.NET Core backend, a MySQL database, and a React frontend to help users monitor and care for their plants. It demonstrates professional software architecture, clean coding practices, and IoT-to-web integration.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Visual Studio Code)

Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API (C# in JetBrains Rider)

Database: MySQL (DataGrip)

Hardware: Arduino Uno + soil moisture sensor (USB serial now, Bluetooth planned later)

Authentication: JWT tokens (planned)

Environment: All components run locally during development

Database & Architecture Highlights

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) with migrations

Repository Pattern with generic base repository

Dependency Injection for clean architecture

Multi-user scalable design with proper foreign key relationships

Cascading deletes for safe data cleanup

Optimized schema for IoT data ingestion & retrieval

Core Tables

Users: authentication and profile info

Devices: device ID, name, type/address, linked to user

Plants: scientific/common names, ideal moisture ranges, optional fun facts

UserPlants: association of users, plants, and devices

SensorHistory: timestamped soil moisture readings

Features
âœ… Current Features

Complete REST API for all entities

CRUD operations for users, plants, devices, and sensor data

Cascading delete (e.g., deleting a user removes all related data)

Date range queries for historical sensor readings

Device-to-plant assignment management

Batch operations (e.g., DeleteManyAsync)

Data cleanup for old sensor readings

ðŸ”® Planned Features

React frontend with real-time dashboards

JWT authentication for secure access

Bluetooth device connectivity

Watering alert system with notifications

Historical trend visualization

Mobile-responsive UI

Development Approach

API-first development: backend foundation completed and tested in Postman

Repository layer: clean abstraction over EF Core

Hardware integration: Arduino Uno currently streams data via USB serial (Bluetooth planned)

Frontend: React dashboards and live visualization are next

Current Status

âœ… Backend foundation complete and tested

âœ… Database schema & cascading relationships configured

âœ… Controllers implemented for all entities

ðŸ”„ Preparing for frontend integration

ðŸ”„ Refining hardware integration for reliable data streaming

Roadmap

The roadmap for Project Daedalus is maintained in the repository.

Showcase Purpose
