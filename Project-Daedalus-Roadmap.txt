Project Daedalus - 10 Week Roadmap

Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

Set up C# ASP.NET Core Web API project in JetBrains Rider
Configure MySQL database with Entity Framework Core Thinking JetBrains DataGrip
Design database schema for multi-device scalability:

Devices table (DeviceId, DeviceName, ConnectionType, ConnectionAddress)
Users (id, username, password, email)
PlantTypes table (id, scienctificName, familiarName, lowrange, highrange, fun-fact)
UserPlantDevice table (userid, plantid, lowrange, highrange, deviceid, connectionAddress)(links users to their plants and devices)
SensorReadings table (timestamp, device_id, plantid, moisture_level)

Phase 2: Arduino Integration

Phase 3: Front end foundation

Phase 4: Feature addition

Week 1 - Project Building Git repo structuring & Database set up:

- Create new ASP.NET Core Web API project
- Create new Entities
- Create new Schema for tables
- Initalize EF core for future migrations

Week 2/3 - Repository Creation and CRUD API endpoints:

- Create Repository Structure including base repository with simple CRUD methods
- Create specific repositories and methods for envisioned features.
- Create Basic structure for API controllers and write CRUD requests
- Write specific controller methods
- Test all API HTTP endpoints in Swagger/Postman

Week 4: Arduino Integration

- Correctly wire Arduino with soil mositure
- Write c++ script stored on Arduino motherboard
- Create a console application on the backend to receive the json data sent by the Arduino
- create a service to pass parsed data to the database
- Test the service

Week 5: Internal Script Service Creation:

Week 6-8: Front end

Features to add/Errors to fix:
- Test for normalized values
- Bluetooth
- Device Registration(automatic or )
- Signup page
- Notifications
